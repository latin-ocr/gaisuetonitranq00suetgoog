supposed that Julius Caesar was born July 12, 100 s.c., but Mommsen
argues from the dates when he held his magistracies that he must have
been born in 102 nc. There is no record of any privilege granted him to
hold office beiore the legal age. His first consulship was in 59 s.c., and
ii he was then iorty-three‚ he must have been born in 102. See Tic Yecr
