emperor from all parts of the imperial administration and
even from foreign states. He must have had under his direc-
tion a large staff of clerks and assistants. We
{man have little exact information as to his functions,
but there is a description of them in the florid
verses of statius1addresscd to Flavius Abascantm, secretary
of Domitian. No doubt Suetonius’s relations with the emperor
were cordial. Hadrian was entirely simple in his mamrers
and assumed no pomp and circumstance to support his dignity:
-he was far too elever a man to be haughty or dull.
We may reasonably suppose that while at the head oi one
department, and a very important one, that of the imperial
mmmm correspondence, Suetonius had free access to an-

interemeris other, that of the imperial archives, and we can

tna impono hardly suppose that he failed to make full use of
‘mm' the opportunity thus offered.
He cites more letters of Augustus than all other writers

combined. There were many letters of this emperor which
had been published. Those which Suetonius cites

notter· cf

Augustus seem rather to be such as would not probably have

been published‚ ior various reasons which are
readily suggested by their contente. And he cites them so
careiully, emphasizing the authenticity of his sources, that it
seems unlikely he was merely repeating what was already
known to the world. One point is significant: he tells us
which letters were in Augustus's own handwriting. His giv-
ing the key to the ciphers of Julius and oi Augustus may also
be significant. The dates and other details oi the wills of
Julius, Augustus and Tiberius are given with extraordinary
1„me precision, as if he had examined the originale.
mentum That Suetonius was familiar with the original
suerranum of the inscription known today as the Monumen-
tum Ancorarium now appears to be an assured fact.2
