judgss in the senate and assembly‚ called duooiri, corresponding ιο the
two consuls at Rome; two quaestores and mdes, with duties similar
tothose of Roman offiUIals of the same title. For the various kinds of
munuum see Smith, Dus. of Aut ao. municipium.

3. abundante . . . unult: aaa ou abundante os tutemet wealth,
lived veru peccefullu to old ooo. The grandfather of Augustus, therefore,
probably spent most of his time at Velitrae; tu auito suburbano iusta
Velitras, in the words of our author (page 48, lines 21 f.). Here he may
have increased his fortmre through usury as an argentarium cf. Auo.
2. 3, 4. 2. baeeelil31pee Augustus nihil: chiastic order, with ad-
versative asyndeton; see Introd. 11. ξ lus. (4) and II. ξ 10. h. The
ellipsis of a verb, such as trudunt or tradiderunt, is hardly felt. Like Sue-
tonius himself, there were doubtless many others who were sager to
search the annale of past ages for information concerning the Octavii,
whether in praise or disparagement. Suetonius names as writers on the
life of Augustus: Julius Marathus (cl. Aug. 79. 2, 94. 3), a freedman,
on personal mattam C. Drusus (cf. Aug. 94. 6), on a story of his in·
fancy; Julius Saturninus (cf. Aug. 27. 2), on his attituds towards pro-

'scriptions3 Aquilius Niger (cf. Aug. 11), on events at Mutina; M. Vale-
rius Messala Corvinus (cf. Aug. 74), on the table guests of Augustus.
From Nicolasof Damascus, the Greek historiari introduced to Augustus
by Herod the Great, are preserved important fragments of his panegyric
on the life of Augustus. In this connection he merely uates (Vit. Aug.
2) that Augustus's father was a senator and his ancestors were notable
for their wealth and goodness.

4. Augustus. . . ecriblt: eg. in his De Vita Sua (cf. Auo. 85. 1),
memoirs of his life and times, in thirteen books, used by Plutarch (cf.
Brut. XXVII, ‘as he himself has stated in his Memoirs'), Cassius Dio
(ef. XLVIII. 44. 4, ⁴ writing down this very fact iu his Memoirs '), Appian
(cf. Β. 0. IV. 110. 463, ‘as he himself wrote in his Memoirs ') and other
later writers. Suetonius himself may have drawn on this work ior much
of his inionnation concerning intimate particulare of the emperor's life.
The statement in Claud. l.l may he compared with that oi Dio (XLVIII.
44. l ff.) on the same subject. Besides this, the Rea Gestae Augusti,
preserved for us in the Monumentum Ancorarium, in particular furuished
informatIon of great value on the times of Augustus ; see Introd. I, pagos
XIV. a, and note ιο page 108, line 2.

5. locuplete et ln qua: note inconcinnity, with change from adjecti-
val moditior ιο relative clause ; see Introd. II. ξ 10 α. primus senator,
etc. ι a statement borne out by Nicolas of Damascus, Va. Auo. 2.
