Emerio Bigot⁷s library, which was purchased in 1706 for the
library which now contains the precious manuscript. It is
the oldest and most reliable, by common agreement, of all the
manuscripts as yet discovered and examined. It lacks the
dedicatory epistle, which was known in the sixth century,
the title of the Lines and the first part of the Julius. The
first five words of our present text, Annum agens autum
densam patrem, are written in red inlr, in capitale, and the
initial A is higher than the oth'er letters, thus indicating the
loss of the first part of the text before the manuscript was
written.

G. - donec Gudianus 268, of the eleventh century, in Wol-
fenbunel. This is the Gudianus II of F. A. Wolf, who made
no use of it. It was first carefully inspected by August
Becker, and was found to be so closely related to M as even
to have copyists' errors in common with M, from which other
manuscripts are free. The results of Becker's studies are to
be found in his Quaestiones Orzncne, published in 1862. The
manuscript was, apparently, derived from an original closely
resembling that of M, if not actually from the same one.

g. — Oodeu Monacensis 5977, of the fifteenth century, now in
the Royal Library‚ Munich. It lacks part of the last chapter
of Domitianus, and gives other evidence of having been copied
from a codex that was mutilated towards the end. Ihm
thought it was copied from G in 1456, while C. L. Smith was
inclined to think it was a copy of the immediate archetype of
G, which had become mutilated, in the meantime, towards the
end.1
· V.-Oodea Vaticanus 1904, of the eleventh or twelfth cen-
tmy, in the Library of the Vatican; the Vaticanus of Lipsius
and Torrentius. It has survived in a somewhat mutilated
condition, ending with decreta sua re in Oolafpnla 3. 3. Itis

marred by many careless errors of the copyist, as well as by
lacuna, so that it is, in general, far surpassed by M, although
