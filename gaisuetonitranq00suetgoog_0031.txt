Susrorvws may be said to possess adistinct style of his own.
Naturally, he exhibita certain characteristica observable in
other writers of the Silver Age: he can scarcely be expected
to avoid the poetic coloring, the use of words and phrases in
altered meanings, even the adoption of novel expressions and
unusual constructions when compared with the usage of wri-
ters of the classical period. Yet his staid and sober intellect
has resisted, toan extraordinary degree, the tendency to rhe-
torical ornamentation so characteristic of Pliny and other wri-
ters of his time. Far more concerned is he with a condensed
ἡ presentation of the facts of ancient history, of ancient life and
institutions. His Lives of the ansars is a marvel of terse,
compact, vigorous narrative, comprising within brief compass
a remarkable amount of interesting and valuable information.
Yet his brevity is not the epigrammatis terseness of a Tacitus.
Suetonius commando attention rather by his simple, clear,
straightforward delineation, but rarely displaying qualities of·
eloquence and genuine dramatic power. Even his longest
periods are seldom tinged with obscurity of expression.
More often, perhaps, it is his very conciseness of utterance,
with undue importance attaching to a single word or phrase,
that causes his reader to pause and reflect upon the full signifi-
canee of a statement. But Suetonius himself never tarries for
calm judgment and accurate weighing of the evidence he pre-
sents. Although he is not lavish of words, he has nevertheless
composed passages of animated, concise narrative that are en·

tirely free from a tendency to abruptness or obscurity.
