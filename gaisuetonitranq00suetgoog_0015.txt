X INTRODUCTION

Our author's friendship for Pliny is insufficient proof that ’

he was born and brought up in Transpadane
Friendslrlp

with Pliny ΘΜ· Μὸθό argues, bui upon very slight evi-

dence, that he was a Roman of Rome. All we
can say is that there is no real evidence to the contrary.

The word coatubcaulie, more than ¹once applied by Pliny to
Suetonius, implies a certain degree of intimacy and affection,
though it is clear that Pliny felt towards his humble friend
the superiority of a protector and patron. But contubernialis
rather implies some approach to equality in their ages than
so great a difference as fifteen years.

As to Suetonius's occupatiou, Pliny calls him scholasticus;
Joannes Lydus,¹ in the sixth century, φιλόλογοςς Suidas,²
11· f , γραμματικός. Are we to take these words merely

1⁸1’10021101 in the sense of “man of learning '', of studious
tastes and pursuits, or in the sense of a professional teacher?
If he was· a toacher, we should be inclined to y'udge by the
style of his writingS, the subjecte, character and method of
his works, aud his evident temperament and point of view,
that he was not a rhetor, but a grammaticus in the strict sense
of the word. Itis true that we learn from Pliny³ that he
was once engaged as an advocate. We know nothing of other
cases in which he may have been engaged, and therefore can
say nothing of the length or success of his career at the bar.

We have, it is true, the impression of a quiet,
and character

, stitious, without much homage, decision or selfassertion and

not gifted with rhetorical ability. Everywhere we observo
his interest in details, in minute correctness, everywhere a
sober and precise mode of expression„nowhere the tendency
to wax eloquent, to adorn his page with the flowers of rhetoric.
He writes much more like a grammarian than a professional
