mu OF SUETONIUS XXV

tores Historiae Augustae, Aurelius Victorand Eutropius, Servius,
the commentator of Vergil, and Macrobius either preserve for
us curious bits of varied informatiou drawn from Suetonius
or base upon his works the lorm and, in some cases, the suh
stance of their own. Ausonius versificd the XII Caesars.
Lactantius and Ambrose were familiar with Suetonius, and
St. J crome took for the model and chief source of his De Virta
Illustribae Suetonius's work of that name. In the early Middle
Ages Paulinus of Milan, Orosius, Aelius Donatus, Cassiodorus,
Priscian, Isidore of Seville show knowledge of Suetonius and
indebtedness to him. Yet by the beginning of the ninth

century the XII Caesare were in danger of being lost to the ‘¹

world, when apparently only one mutilated manuscript was
known, the archetype of all that we now possess. This was
fortunately multiplied in the reign oi Charlemagne by the
copyists working at Tours under the direction of Alcuin. ’
Soon after, Eginhard composed his life of that great monarch
in close imitation of Suetonius’s Aupuetas. Even in the twclith
century William of Malmesbury cites the Prata and John of
Salisbury makes use of excerpts from the Caesars.
