m. Clauses introduced by ut, often preceded by'r‘to and simi-
lar words, are used to express a restriction or proviso:

itu magnos . . . esse voluit et tumen part ture essent, Aug. 56.2;
sed rt . . . expergisceretur, Aug. 78.1; nort tumen et. . . eederet,
Aua. 89.1 ; sed ut . . . redierint, Jul. 69.

a. No writer, probably, uses a larger number of participles
than Suetonius, who employs them in a variety ol construc-
tions, often for the sake of greater brevity, but hardly with
the admirable perspicuity of Livy. Eight, ten or more par-
ticiples occur in a single period:

eight ina sentence of five lines in Jul. 623 ten in a somewhat longer

sentence in Aug. 16.1‚ Sr'eulum bellum. . . effectu fourteen in a single
long period in Aur. 27. 3 f., Nam et Pinarium . . . tristeris perisse.

(l) The future active participle is often used to express
purpose or design, as in Greek, as well as time and other re-
latione:

successuri sibi, Jul. 213 quamprimum transfretaturi, Jrl. 34.1;
vindicaturusse‘quid . . . constitutum esset, Jul. 30.1; Tiberium . . .
dimissurus et Beneventum usque prosecuturus, nep. 97. 3.

(2) The perfect participle is commonly used in the present
sense after Livy's time:

nardo . . . erosit. . . elatu laevo. . ‚trahere Jul. 64; subsecutus,
Aur. 8.1.

(3) The present is sometimes used because of the lack of a
perfect active participle:
Ac subinde . . . admonens, Jul. 65.

(4) The impersonal use of the participle in the ablative
absolute occurs, often with the force of an adverb:

augurato, Auo. 7.2; consulto, Jel. 56. 4; sortito, Aup. 30. 1.
