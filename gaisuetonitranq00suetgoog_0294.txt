cleopatrae: observa the adversative asyndeton, in strong contrast with

18. quam servatam, eta: Dio (LI. 11. 3 ff.) and Plutarch (Ant.
LXXVIII) both record Octavian’s great desire to have the Egyptian
queen livetograce his triumph. But too proud was the spirit oi the queen,

died in her fortieth year after a reign ol twenty-two years, oi which more
than fourteen were in joint rule with Antony. Dio and Plutarch cast
doubt upon the manner of her mysterious death and mention other
means that were said to have been employed. Velleius and Florus
follow the traditional account. Plutarch states, however, that an effigy
oi Cleopatra was borne in Octavian's triumphal procession with an esp
clinging to her arm; thus indicating Octavian’s belief, at least, in the
commonly accepted version. The poets have preserved the common
tradition, as witness Horace (οἀ. Ι. 37. 26 n),

Corpore combiberet venenam,
