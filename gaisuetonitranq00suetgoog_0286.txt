¹ son of the L. Aemilius Paulus who was brother ol the tnumvir M. Aemilius

Lepidus. The father was proscribed with the consent oi Lepidus because
he had been one ol the senators who voted to declare Lepidusa public
enemy ior having jolned Antony. Allowed to escape to Brutus, he later
went to Miletus, where he persisted in remaining even when parrioned by
the triumvirs. See App, B. U. IV. 12. 45, 37. 135; Dio XLVII. 6. 3.

Octaviam though Lepidus was really responsible for his proscription, as
already noted.

1e. Post Pompei lugam : aiter his deleat near Naulochus, in 36 aa,
Sextus fied to Lesbos, where he hoped to find asylum with Antony. Fail-
ing oi this, 113 was finally put to death by Titius, an officer ol Antony,
in 35113. For the details see App, Β. 0. V. 133. oso-144. 666; Dio

19. quem ex Altica, etc. ε summoned from his province oi Africa on
July first, 36 ac, Lepidus obeyed orders, but acted independently in
taking Lilybaemn and proceeding at his leisure to Messana. Here he
entered into treasonable negotiations with Plennius, at that time holding
the city against Agrippa. Lepidus was permitted to sack Messana. See
App, Β. 0. V. 122. 604 il. ; Dio XLIX. 11, 2 il. superbientem, eta:
paffed cp with confidence in his twenty lectona ond cluiminy ibe chief r6le
for himself by intimitation und threcia. Lepidus was now in command
oi the twelve legions brought with him from Africa and the eIght given
him by Plennius, l’ompey's lieutenant at Lilybaeum. Appian (Β. 0. V.
123. 509) gives the number as twenty-two ol infantry, while Velleius
(ΙΙ. 80. 2) speaks oi the number as amplias viciati legionum. The two
additional legions, according to AppIan (Β. 0. V. 104. 430 ii), were the
remnant oi iour fresh legions irom Alrlca that had escaped shipwreck oli
Lilybaeum. Velleius states that the iolly and audacIty of Lepidus reached
such a pitch that he claimed the entire victory as his own and ordered
Octavian to withdraw from Sicily.

21. spoliavit exercitu: his legions were unwilling to enter upon
another civil war, were not won over to Lepidus even by the sack oi
Messana, and hastened to go over to Octavian in a body. See App, Β. 0.
