way to these revisions and enactments Among these lepos Iuliae, too
numerous to mention in tull, those relating 10 social and financial reiorms
are almost as important as his political innovatione. The ica Iulia dc
adulteriis 01 17 ac. prescribed particularly severe penalties 101 the guilty

18 nc. regulated 00110111 marriages, imposed dIsabilities on unmarried
persons and lixed rewards 101 those who had married and reared children.
The latter law was vigorously opposed and was not finally passed till near
the close 01 his reign, 11191.0.,111111110101101110111010000<1 and its penalties
alleriated. His tapes sumptuariae were intended to check extravagant
tastes and so encourage marriage. Apparently, Augustus twice took

elections; but the general enactmentdc ambitu seems to have been
passed on the later occasion. Cf. Dio LIV. 16. 1 ff, LV. 5. 3, LVI. 1. 2 ;
