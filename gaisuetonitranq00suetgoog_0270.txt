their way, to Octavian. Nicolas of Damascus (Vit. Auo. 30), probably
giving Octavian's own version, says that the plot and the repert accusatory
of Octavian were both the invention ot Antony himself. See Merivale,
Hist. af Rern, 111.4 80.

5. perieulum . metuens: Velleius says (11. 60. 5) :· C. Caesar
incenis cotidianis Antonii petebatur insidiis. veteranos: sc. paternoa;
ef. Vell. H. 01. 2, primamque a Galatia, moa a Casilino veteranos eaciait
paternos. The levies were made in the early part oi October, 44 aa, at
these small towns in the vicinity ot Capua. He was later joined by the
lepio Martia and lepio qando.

6. quanta potuit largitione: by means of aa lorpea bonnty aa lc
conld command. Octavian's donativa of 500 denarii, about 38000, per
man was unprecedented in amount as well as in the fact that it was at his
own expense3 cf. Cic, ad Att. XVI. 8. 1; M: A. 1. 1.1, coercitam
privato consilio et privata impensa comparavi. iussaeque. . .prae-
esee: aad caiti ardere to bold command, witi tlte ranle'os propraetor,
of ibe arrnp be irad procared. By vote of the senate on January first,
43 aa, Octavian was accorded senatorial rank among the praetorii and
invested with the imperinm. A second decree gave him the ornamenta
consularia. He himself states (M. A. Ι. 1. 3ff.): Ob qaae senatus de
cretio bonoridcie in ordinem saara rne adlepit 0. Pansa A. Hirtio consa
libas, consularem locam airnal dans cententiacserendae, et imperinm mibi
dedit. The nominative forms oi titles oi pro-magistrates, praeornat,
propraetor, etc, are found only occasionally. Here the form pro
praetore indicates that Octavian was exercising the authority of a' praetor
without ever having held the office.

shut up in Mutina since the close oi 44 nc. The battles mentioned
below were fought in April, 43 no.

9. demandatum: entraeted; said to occur more often in Suetonius
than in any other writer: cf. page 38, line 17, demandavit,· page 43,Ι
line 2, demandaverat; etc. tertio menae: not to be taken too literally;
Octavian left Rome late in December and the decisivo battles were
fought in April. ι

10. duobus proeliis: the first occurred on April 15, 43n'.o., at
Forum Gallorum, about eight miles from the beleagnered city on the Via
Aemilia. There is probably no good reason ior doubting Dio's state·
ment (XLVI. 38. 1) that Octavian was not personally- engaged in thie
battle. Antony's slanderous story oi his ignominious flight seems as
groundless as the baser calumny oi persistent repert that Glycon, the
