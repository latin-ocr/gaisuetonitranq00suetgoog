lamminas cladesque. In 16 rac. the filgambri, Usipetes and Tencteri
crossed the Rhiue and plundered Roman Germany and Gaul. Their
meeting with M. Lollius, while unexpected, resulted in his being put to
rout and lesing the eagle 01 the fitth legion ; cf. Dio LIV. 20. 41. ; Τ11.,
Α10.Ι.10.3; Vell. 11. 97. 1. M. Lollius, 1011110121 e.c., wassomuch in
the confidence 01 Augustus that even the failure 01 his German campaign
did not deter the emperor from sending him to the llast in 211. as the .
companion and adviser 01 his grandson Gaius; ei. Tib. 12. 2 ; Vell. 11.
102. 1. But he later incurrcd the eumity 01 Gaius and soon cameto his
death. Horace's panegyric (Od. IV. 9) may have been prompted by 1
desire to ward 011 hostile critIcism such as later beiell Lollius at the hands
01 Velleius (Π. 97. 1). Velleius may have been prejudiced by Lollius's
hostility 1ο Tiberius. Varianam: in 6-4 rac. P. Quintilius Varus had
been imperial governor 01 Syria, quam pauper diuitem inpressas diues
pauperem reliquit, according to Velleius (ΙΙ. 117. 2). Appoiuted 10110-
ceed Tiberius in Germany about 6 11, by his severe treatment 01 these
high-spirited provinciale he provoked a revolution under the patriot Armi-
nius (Hermann). He was entrapped and suffered a disgraceful defeat,
9111, in what Tacitus designatas (Aac. l. 60. 5) as the saltus Teutobur-
giensis. ‘The scene 01 the disaster might be almost anywhere between
the middle Weser and the Ems ’,1111111111 observes in his note on the
Tacitus passage. But for the timely success 01 Tiberius in Pannonia and
Dalmatia, it was generally believed, the victorious Germans would have
formed 1 junction with the Pannonians; 11. Τ16. 17. 1. See Dio LVI.

which were not subsequently reconstituted ; see Furncaux‚ Aac. os Tuo,
Vol. 1, lntred., page 122 and note 1. The eagles 01 these legions were re-

Ill. Relictis, XII. 42, W. A. Oldfatlrer and H. V. Canter present striking
arguments agaiust the commonly accepted view 01 the significance 01 the
defeat 01 Varus and argue that ‚the policy 01 Augustus In Germauy was tc
make a ‘buffer' state out 01 the district between the Rhiue and the Elbe,
perhaps extend it even further. cum duce: Dio (LVI. 21. 5) states
thet Varus and his most distInguished lieutenants committed suicide 3 11.
