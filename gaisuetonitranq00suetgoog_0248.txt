7. restionem: a rope-malam only here in this sense. Plautus
(Most. 884) uses the word of ‘one who (10001100 10 110 flogged’. See
Introd. 11. §L b. 0 pago Thurino ε from 1110 district os 11111111,ι used

Thurina (page 48, 11110 32). Τ110111, 0001 1110 hay of Tarentum and 001
far from the site of the ancient Sybaris, was one 01 the latest 01 1110
Greek colonies‘in Magna Graecia; founded in 443 nc. by colonists sent
out from Athens, among them the historian Herodotus and the orator
Lysias. A Roman colony with Latin rights was settled there in 193 nc.
under the new name 01 Copia. cf. Liv. XXXIV. 53. 1, XXXV. 9. 7.

8. argentarium: money-chanaam banhem as a private bankerfor
the exchange and loan 01 money, originally distinguished from the num-
mularius, astate officer 01 1110 mint who assayed and distributed newly
coined money. Later the nummularii did a regular bankiug business,
receiving deposita 01 funds, opening current accounts and making
learns, in addition to their official functione. Mensarius, another term
for ‘banker', was used with reference to his mensa, 01 ι0000100, as
τραπεζίτης 01 1110 Greek money-changes, still in evidence on the streete 01
modern Athens. By imperial times 1110 three ternis had come 10 110 used
indiscriminately: witness the 1001 11101 011 three were applied tothe ances-

tors 01 Augustus, asisseen 11010 0 comparison of our' passage with Aug. 4. 2, ’

where nummularius and mensurius both 00001. 10 Ner. 5. 2 argentarius
is apparently used to mean ι0111010011111. The general attitude towards
persons 01 11110 occupation was doubtless influenced by the wealth and
standing of those concerned. Nothing further is known of a rope-welk 01
1110 (10111111 at Tlmrii and 0 bank iu the family at Thurii or Velitrae.
