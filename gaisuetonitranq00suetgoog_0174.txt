le. (Oa.) cornelium Dolabellam: consul uc. 81 with M. Tullius
Deoida, afterward governed Macedonia and celebrated a triumph over the
Thracians (Cic, in Pisoa. XIX). He is to he distinguished nom the
propraetores CilicIa whose legate was Verres (Cic, trifera-,143 II. 1. 15).
lIe was defended by (l. Aurelius Cottaand Hortensius (Cic, Brut. 92. 317 ;
Valer. Max„ VIII. 9. 3; Plus.. Gaas. IV). There is disagreement as to
the date of this prosecution. Plutarch agrees with Velleius Paterculus
(II. 43) and Tacitus (litabat). The statement oi Suetonius puts it in
rac. 77, when Caesar was 23. Tacitus says ι uno et vicensimo (ariao).

19. trIumphalem: unusual as a noun, without vir,· some MSS. add
virusq- cf. pago 63, line 31. repetundanrm postulavit: proseouted

him under Sulla's law (82-79 nc). The quaestio dc repet-undis was one oi ,

the nine quaestiones, or permanent crimiual courts established by Sulla.
It was a recognized custom ior young nobles tc make their debut in public
lile by prosecuting some prominent politician. Rome had uc magistrates
charged with the duty of instituting proceedings in such cases. The
genitive, instead oi the ablativa with de, ispost-Augustan.

20. absolutoque: sc. Dolabellc; the omission cf the subject oi the
abiative absolute Is rather harsh3 Introd. II. ᾖ 9. α. (5). et ad decli-
nandam. . . et ut, etc: note the cob'rdination ci the different final
constructione ; Introd. II. ς 10. a.

21. Apollonio Moloni: the father's name Molo is attached to the
sons, Apollonius, like a modern surname. Scine would read Molonis.
This Apollonius Molo was also Cicero’s teacher. Plutarch places this
perlod oi study after Caesar's capture by the pirates and before his prose*-
cuticn of Dolabella. We can hardly determine from this whether Caesar ’
actually spent any tIme with Mola, or only intended to do sc.

2³. dum . . . traicit: cium, ‘while’, is normaliy used by Suetonius.

24. Pharmacussam Insulam: a small island near the coast oi Asia
above Miletus; not to be coniouuded with the two islets between Attica
and Salamis. a praedonibus: Plutarch's version oi the story (Caes.
II) is scmewhat different. Valerius Maximus (VI. 9. 15) agrees with
this. In regard tc the prevalence oi piracy in the Mediterranean atthis
period, read App Mithr XCII. sqq. The subju atron ol these pirateswas
one ol Pompey’ s brilliant achievements
