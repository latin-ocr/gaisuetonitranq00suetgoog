³1. Scalas naiades: tlte Riuumeleers' Stoirs. Platner (Aac.
Rome, 134) thinks a ssight oi steps at the north comer oi the Palatino,
leading up from the Forum behind the temple of Castor, may have been
the stairway here mentioned. Yet the location seems hardly in keeping
with our author’s statements, primo iustu Romanum sorum . . . postea
iu Palatio. Was the house oi Calvus iu Palatio, also? The language
here does not so indicate. Calvi: Gaius Licinius Calvus, distinguished
orator and poet, to whom his intimate friend Catullus addressed three oi
his extant odes (XIV, L, XCVI). He lived from 82 10 41 nc.

ever thought proper that it should be so called, hut because Caesar lived
on the Palatina and had his chief residence there, and his house received
irom the entire hill a certain degree oi fame that was also associated with
the previous residence oi Romulus on it. And ior this reason, even ii the
emperor lodges somewhere else, his abiding place has the name oi
palatium.’
