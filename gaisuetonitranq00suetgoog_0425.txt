1166 rores on AUGUSTUS [risa ros

22. ephebos : = ἐφήβους ; see Introd. 11. ᾗ 1. d. These eplebi were .
Greek youths past the age oi eighteen, but not yet possessed oi lull citizen
rights, who had prescribed military and gymnastic training as a part oi
their education Capreae still preserved the Greek training, having
belonged to Naples until quite recently ; see note to page 98, line sl.

25. diripiendi: scrambliap sor; ci. Quint.,1rrst., VI. 1. 47: talos
iecit iri medium, quos illi diripere coeperam. See Introd. ΙΙ. 5 9. c. (4).

Α 26. missilia: presente thrason by the emperor. The missing word is,
probably, omnium, ‘oi all sorts ’, proposed by C. F. W. Mllller3 ci. Ner.
ll. 2, sparso ei populo missilia omnium rerum per omnes dies. In our
passage, as in the one just quoted, the genitives are appositional or
epexegetical; see Introd. H. ᾖ 4.f.

28. Vicinam capreis insulam: ori island rrecr Capri ; the explana-
'tion oi these words that is most simple and most plausible, topographically
as well as grammatically, as has been pointed out by W. B. McDaniel in
T. A. Ρ. Α. XLV (1914). 29 if. The writer oi this article has argued con-
vincingly that the island here referred to was the islet which is today
knownas Il Monacone, ⁶ Great Mcnk ', to the east of the Faraglioni group
oi precipitous cliiis. To this islet, then, Augustus gave the name ‘apra
gopolis’ when members oi his party frequently resorted thither to while
away their idle hours. Masgaba, it would seem, was the leader in these
diversions and, at his death, was honored with a tomb at the spot which
he had once made so popular as to attract the emperor's notice when,
from his villa, he observcd members oi his retinue in their repeated excur-
sionstothisplace. Here,too,theanniversaryoiMasgaba'sdeathwascele-
brated in the manner indicated in the emperor’s verses. Apragopolim:
eommunia or Lami os Do·Notlliaps; a Greek name made up from
ἀ privative 1- tsffl (of. epicro)÷rtls. See L. and S., s. o. πόλις, Ill.

30. Masgaban: since Masgaba was the name oi a son oi King
Masinissa, this favorite oi Augustus was, possibly, a Numidiae or an
African by descent; see Liv. XLV. 13.

31. Κτίστηνι the Greek word for the ‘ founder’ oi a city or colony.
The joke consiste in the fact that the islet was, probably, no more than a
barren rock.

Paga 105. 3. Κτίστου st, ete: Isee asconder's lomb abloze witi

re.
fi4. Thrasyllum} ci. Tib. 14. 4: Thrasyllum quoque mathematicam,
