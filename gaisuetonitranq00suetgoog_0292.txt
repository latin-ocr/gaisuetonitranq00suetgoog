ingly described by Horace (Sat. I. b). See Dio LI. 4. 3 ff.

7. repetita Italia: hc returned to Italy5 to be translated as an inde-
pendent clause, with a tull stop at diffracto, though the first main verb
inthe Latin is pern. tempestate . . . conflictatus: twice ermonatcrss
ing a atoma ia tlte oet es arcuatam ci. Liv. l. 3. 8, in traiecta Albulae

8. promunturia: possibly, the promontories oi Rhium in Achaia
and oi Antirrhium in Aetolia, on which stand today the dilapidated
ruins oi the Venetian forts Kestro Moreas and Kastro Boumelita, rs-
spectively. These promontories form the narrow entrance to the Corin-
thian Guli, now called the Little Dardanelles.

9. montes Ceraunios: the tufam scopulos, Acroceraunio oi Horace
(Od. Ι. 3. 20), modern Khimara ;,a range oi mountains extending from

gerous for vessels: oi. Luc. V. 652 s.‚ scopuloso Ceraunia noctae
summo timeat. The term, Acroceraunia, ‘Thunder Heights ’, was prop

liburnicarum : a name given to the light war vessels, long and narrow,
modeled aiter the speedy craft oi the piratical Liburnians, a tribe ot
Illyricum on the eastern coast oi the Adriatic. The name of avesselis
thus a proper name. To vessels of this pattern Octavian probably owed,
in large part, his victory at Actium. Thus Horace says (apra Ι. 1-4) :

Ibis Liburnis inter olto aonium,
Amice, propugnaculo,

Paratus omne Caesares periculum
Subire, 1111111111, tuo,

Antony's Egyptian lieet. Usually applied to a vessel oi two banks oi
ocra, the word is used ot vessels oi ten banks in Gal. 37. 2, Fobrtccctt et
