Chapter 24. Instancee oi Military Disciplina

21. In re milliari, etc. : in a military 666616 boib made many changes
aad instituted many reforma. Observe the medial position 61 mulia.
Among the principal changes may be mentioned those relating 2ο (1) the
number oi legions, (2) the assignment oi distinct commandens, 166616·
legionis, to each legion, (3) the changed position oi the praefectus oa
atrorum, (4) the emperors bodyguani, (5) the city cohorts and patrol.
TakIng these in order, (1) aiter Actium Augustus was leit with upwards
oi fifty legions. Mommsen (Rea Geai. 68-16) thinks this number was
reduced to eighteen‚ but was raised to twenty-six at the time oi the
Pannonian uprising 1116 1.». Ε. G. Hardy (Journ. Phil. XXHI. 29-44)
argues 161 the number twenty-three as against Mommsen's eighteen.
The number at the death oi Augustus was twenty-five. CI. Dio LV. 23.
1 ii. and see references cited by Mommsen. (2) Legati legionis were now
put in command oi separate legions and were distinct from 2116 legati oi the
provinces. They served 66 deputies oi the emperor, to whom the oath 61
allegiance (sacramentum) was now taken. They ranked as provincIal
vicegerents under the legatus Augusti. See Furneaux, Ana. os Tacitae,
Vol. I, Introd, page 124. (3) Legions now generally had permanent costra
in the provinces, so that the praefectus castrorum became an officer oisemo
importance. (4) The cohors praetoria now came to be the regular body-
guard of the emperor and was stationed in the vicinity 61 Rome; ci.
Dio LIII. 11. 5. (ὅ) Α2 first there were three cohortes urbanae under
the command oi the praefectus urbi,· the number being later increased.
The seven cobortes vigilum, instituted in 5 nn, acted as a kind 61 police
patrol and fire department and* were recruited largely from the freedmen;
see Dio LV. 26. 4 f. On these changes see Marquardt, rtem. Stadiso.11.²
