to conceal their dislike and suspicion of that venerable body.
We can also discover some traces of pride and interest in the
equestrian order, to which he himself belonged by birth.
Consciouslyor unconsoiously, he appears to have shared the
prejudices, sympathies and illusions of the aristocratic classes.

Septicius Clarus, his second patron, was an intimate friend
of Pliny, his first. To him were dedicated the Letters of
Pliny, as well as Suetonius's XII Caesars. Itis Ptoteeteuby
