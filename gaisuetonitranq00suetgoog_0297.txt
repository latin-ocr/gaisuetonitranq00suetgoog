238 noras on AUGUSTUS [rios so

Pege ot. 1. Ptolemaeum: ue uma of tae uocemue cr. nio m.
16. 5. regern ιο voluisse, etc: the acts and lives 01 the Ptolemiesirom
the time 01 Philopator (222-205 ac), at least, had not been such as to
provoke admiration from so constructive a statesman as Augustus.

2. Aegyptum.. Judaeum: Roman legions had been quertered in
Egypt in bb rac. when Aulus Gabinius restored Ptolemy Auletes ¹to his
throne. Yet Julius Caesar had hesitated to make a province oi it for
tear that, under sorno hot-headed governor, it might iurnish material for
arevolt; cf. Jul. 35. 1. The last prince 01 the Lagid house was now,

30 nc, dead, however, and Augustus assumed the position, oi a Ptolemy '

with reference to Egypt. Under his administration, then, it became the
private domain oi the princeps, with a government unlike that 01 any
province. lt was under a praefectus, or ‘viceroy ', who was the direct
servant oi the emperor and responsible to him alone, uniting in his
person the duties 01 both leputus and procurator 01 the ordinary imperial
provinces. This praefectus 01 equestrian rank was supported by three
legions (aiter Augustus, by two) and performed all the ceremonial
iunctions of the Egyptian kings. The revenues and taxes became tlie
private property 01 the emperor. Resides the praefectus there were at
least two officials 01 rank known as the iuridicua Aegypti, for the ad-
ministering 01 justice at Alexandria, and the idioloyue (zoarae, Strab.
XVII. l. 12), ior the management 01 certain financial matters, both ap
pointed by the emperor. Yet the prInciple 01 the dyarchy did not hold
in Egypt, however desirous Augustus might have been to have it appear
aa subject, like the provinces to the Roman people3 cf. M. A. XXVII.
5. 24, Aegyptum imperio populi Romani educi. Iis status remained
essentially unchanged from its organisation in 30 rac. to the time 01
Diocletian. cf. Dio LI. 17. l ff.; Tac, Huc. 1. 11, Ana, II. 59. 4. See
Momms, Pr0c. of ibe Rom. amp. (Engl. Trans.) II. 252-329; Arnold,
' Rom. Syri. of Proo. Admin.² (1906), 22 m, 128 ff.

'· ³. habiliorem, etc: Egypt fed the Roman population during four

months 01 every year, so that it may readily be understood why Augustus
should consider it necessary to keep so important a source 01 supply
under his direct control ; ci. Plin, Puuep. 31. 2 : Percrebruerat antiquitus
urbem nostrum nisi opibus Aegypti cli sustenturique noa posse. Aurelius
Victor (Epit. l. 6) gives an estimato oi the annual imports in the time oi
Augustus: Huius [Augusti] tempore ec Aeyrypto urbi annua ducenties
centena miliafrumenti inferebantur.
