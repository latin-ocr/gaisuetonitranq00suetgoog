Parthians could be conquered only by a king; ci. Plut, 0000. LX.
Hence arose the repert that L. Cotta would propose that Caesar should
have the title oi king conferred on him ; ci. Jni. 79. 3. post receptes
Hispanias: a construction becuming increasingly frequent irom Livy's
tlme.

³1. Apolloniam: in Illyricum, directly opposite Brundisium.
While not a university center like Athens and Rhodes, Greek toachers
may have resorted thither as a place most accessible from Italy. Octavius
seems to have tehen his teachers with him; cf. Aac. 89. 1. Hie main
object was doubtless thetraining in military matters which would fit him
ior the Parthian campaign 3 ci. Vell. Π. 59, 4: Et patratio bellic civilibus
011010110Μο11 liberalibus diciplinis 0101010110 indolem incenis Apolloniam

commilitonem.

Pago 50. 1. studiis vacavit: devoted himself to 110 studies, conciet
ing quite as much in the training in arms as in the arts, no doubt, since
he was to be one of the two morata· equiturn on Cacsar's Parthian
campaign. In his retinue at this time were Agrippa and Maecenas,

letter from his mother. . Only upon his landing at Lupiae, in the vicinity
01 Brundisium, did 110 learn 01 Caesar's will and hIs own adoption. Cf.

4. urbe repetita: the time 01 his entrance into the city cannot be
exactly determined‚ but it was probably at tha end 01 April or beginning
01 May, 44 n.c., in the absence oi Antony, who was then consul. Velleius
(11.19. 6) thus describes his return to Rome: Gni adventanti Romam
