from the extant inscription are noticeable, these have been
shown to be rather inconsiderable or else intentional on the
part of Suetonius, This is on the presumption that tho
passages in question from the Moiirnnentnm Aiicyrcaum are
not deviations from the original oonsulted hy Suetonius. In
any event, it is unlikely that other manuscript editions of

Augustus’s account of his own arhievements were then in
existence. Itis quite probable, therefore, that Suetonius, while

secretary (cb epicactis) to the emperor Hadrian, oonsulted the
original document in the imperial archives, as well as the will
and letters of Augustus.

As to the letters of lulius, we. know that many of thern had
been published. These and others may have been preserved

in the imperial archives. lt is not unreasonable
{mm οἱ to suppose that Suetonius exarnined the originale.

The precision of his description ol the form of
Caesar’s letters to the Senate suggests this inference: quas
palmam videtur ad popinas et seranna rnerncriolis libelli coacer-
tisse‚ cam antea consides et (lieres non nisi baimcersc rbem
comptas irriderent.l

On the whole, however, Suetonius cannot have studied the
Palatino archives long and exhaustively3 his tenure of the
office ab opicerdis came too late and lasted too shorta time. Aa
for documents accessihle to the public, those he had had time
to consult beforez—the octo populi and other recorda ol the
times involved in his narrativcs.

We now come to the question of the date of the publication
of the XII Caesars. Spartianus tells us² that Suetonius lost
his office at the same time as Septicius Clarus, te.
122 sn. doarmes Lydus³ states that the XII
Caesare were dedicated to Septicius Clarus, while
hc was praetorian prefect. The dedication and several other
pages at the beginning of the Life of Julius were lost between
