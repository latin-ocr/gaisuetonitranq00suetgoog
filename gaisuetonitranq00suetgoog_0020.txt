LIFE OF SUETONIUS XV

This account 01 Augustus'e achievements was contained
in 000 01 three rolls left by him athis death.¹ Suetonius
etates that Augustus desired that it should be inscribed
“ 00 bronze tablets to beplaced inirent 01 his mausoleum. The
inscription was, apparently, set up at Rome in the place desig·
00101, but actually engraved not on 1000100, but 00 bronze 0000,
pillars, which have not survived.² Suetonius, no doubt, knew
thie copy at Rome. It ie not likely, however, that he would de
pend upon the copy when the original, in the emperor's own
handwriting, was available for his use in the imperial archivee.

in Asia Minor, which, but 101 some slight 001 insignifioant
alterations, was probably an exact copy, though in its present
’ condition much mutilated, 01 the inscription 00 bronze pillare
at Rome. '

Many scholare have undertaken the interesting task 01
comparing Suetoniue's Augustus with the 1100010001010
Aneyrnnnm as it stands today.⁸ The net result of their
investigatione seems to indicate Suetonius's thorough 00000101Ι -

hie purpose. 80010 striking verbal coincidencee have been
noted, while the contente 01 0011010 chapters are essentially
in agreement with passages in the 1100010001010 Ancy-
