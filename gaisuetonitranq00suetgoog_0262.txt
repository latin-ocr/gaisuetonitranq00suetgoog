urbe condenda regnum adeptus est. Similar is the use of auspicato in
Cia, de Dic. I. 9. 3; Principio tutus urbis parens Romulus aon solum
cambato urbem comburerentur ettam optimae augur scisse traditur.
Such an ablativa approximates the adverbial usage seen on page 1, line
99, festinato ,· page 89, line 7, secreto. See Introd. H. §a a. ( ).

16. dicantur: subjunctive mood as stating the cause assigned in
support oi the motion oi Plancus. ab auctu: the derivation that con·
nects augustus with augeo is probably correct3 see the 0vld passage
quoted in note to line 9, above. Accius (= incrementum), ‘increase (in

dignity)', is rare till the post-Augustan period.
⁹ 1⁷. gestu gustuve: mocemeat orseedinp. The alliteration is accl-
dental. The reference is probably to the movements of the sacred
chickens and the manner in which they took their food. On such
auguries see Greenidge, Rom. Publ. Life, page 164 et passim. Such a
derivation iails to explain the radical part oi the word, cup. Rnnlue:
in Annales, irg. 389 (Baehr., P. L. M.²), quoted by Varro, R. R. 111. 1.
9. The hexameter verse preceding this one is Septingenti sunt paulo
plus aad minas aaut.

18. augurio: by cupam ; te. by the flight oi birds or the feeding oi
the sacred chickens. Augur contains the root oi aab. Possiblycupustus,
itseli a word oi religlous import, through popular etymology came to be
associated with the same root because oi its frequent use with such words
of ritual. Both the idea ci ‘augury’ and that oi ‘increase ', as seen from
the Ovid passage (in notato line 9, above), were at least in the Roman
mind in connection with this word. Note the paronomesla in augusto
augurio.

20. Quadrimus: tc. aiter September 98, 59 nc. As seen in the note
to page 47, line 96, Octavius died while returning from Macedonia
towards the close oi 59 nc. or early in 58 nc. Duodecimum annum
agens: in hta twelftt year ,· beiore September 93, 51 nc.

21. avlam Jullam: see note to line10, above. The young Octavius’s
naturally wealr health was not improved, Drumann thinks (Geacd.
Rome, IV.² 961), by the excessivo care bestowed upon him by J ulia and
Atia. dehmctam, etc. : delivered a funeral oration to tte assunbled
people in conor os. Our author uses morte wengi or defungi alone as
equal to mori; see page 45, line 98, nepae sua morte defunctus esa·
