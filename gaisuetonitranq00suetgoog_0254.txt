of Aapustus's mother. Cicera, replying to Antony’s stricturas on the
ancestry of Augustus, says (Phil. 111. 6. 15): Videte quam despiciamur
omnes qui camus e municipiis, id eat, omnes plane. Quotus enim qais-
qae nostrum nonest? Quod autom municipium non contemnit isqui
Aricinum tanto opere despicit, etc. Antony apparently disrcgardod the
imapines senatoriae of Balbus and his relationship to Pompey.

Etruscus of Horace, Sat. Ι. 10. 61 f. He was the author of tragedias (cf.
Acro on Hor, Ep. 1. 4. 3) and a writer of epigrams. M. A. Weichert
(Commentatio Π de Cassio Parmensi Poeta, Grimae, 1834, pp. 36 ff.)

pedition of Augustus was composed by this Cassius and would refer the
anonymous verses of Ana. 70. 1 to the same author. quadam epistula: Ι
