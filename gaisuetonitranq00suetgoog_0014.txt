declined by him. Itis true that young menos senatorial rank
were eligible to the tribunate at twenty-five; but Suetonius
was only an eques, and we do not know at what age he was
eligible, nor that the post was obtained for him at the earliest
possible date.

The allusion in the last sentence of the Life of Nero: Post
or’pr’ati aanor adulescente me, etc, apparently showing that Sue
tonius was adulescens in 88 an, twenty years after Nero’s
death, implies an earlier date than 77 an. for his birth.

Mommsen dates Pliny's letter I. 24, in 97 ao. The de
scription of the tastes and habits of Suetonius sketched in that

letter is unsuitable to a young man of twenty. The word
contubernalis used by Pliny in letter 1. 24 and elsewhere is in-

appropriate if Suetonius was fifteen years younger than Pliny.
The 94th letter to Trajan, requesting for Suetonius the ica trium

liberorum, seems less appropriate as applying to a man of thirty·
six than to one several years older. This letter dates from
111-113 an.

Pliny's impatience for the long delayed publication of
Suetonius's writings, expressed in letter V. 10, in 106 am, is
more appropriate if Suetonius was older than twenty-nine at
that date.

Mace argues for 69 an. as the most probable date for
Suetonius’s birth. His father Suetonius Laetus¹ took partin

the campaign of that year as tribanus angusti· ⁶9 mu„
riccius of the Thirteenth Legion, which had been most probable

lately called to Italy after a long service in Pan· ⁶⁸²⁰
nonia. After the defeat at Bedriacum, this legion was forced
by Vitellius to build the amphitheater of Cremona3 then its

officers were replaced by Vitellians, and it was sent back to ›

Pannonia. It seems rather more probable that Suetchius
Laetus would have married at Rome, in his prosperity, in
68 an, than somewhere else soon after the battle of Bedriacum.

1The Codex Memmiauus, oldest and most reliable MS. of the Xll caesara,
reads Laetus iu Otho 10. 1.; the other MSS, Lenis.
