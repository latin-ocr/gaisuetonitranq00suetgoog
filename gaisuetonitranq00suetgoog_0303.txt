XIV. 32. Their chief town, Metulum, identified with the modern Miitt
ilng or Metlika‚ was finally subdued by Augustus in 34 ac. after a stub-
born resistance ; see Dio XLIX. 35. 1 ff. Augustus then turned his arms
against the Pannoniam, also an lllyrian tribe, to practice his soldiers‚

Fufius Geminus and the troops that had been left there under his com-
mand. Against the Dalmatians both Augustus and Agrippa made suo-
oessful expeditioris, but not without inomning many hardships. See Dio

finally subdued by Augustus in 25 no. only after a most obstinate resist-
ance. Indead, Augustus iell ill and was forced to retIre to Tarraco,
leaving Gaius Antistius Vetus and, later, Titus Carisius to en¹d operatione
there. Horace (Οά. ΠΙ. 14. 3 f.) celebrates the emperor's victorious
