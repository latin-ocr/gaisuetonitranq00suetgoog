the conflict end with the ssight of Cleopatras ships and of Antony in his
mad pursuit ol the queen. The victory was gained only when Octavian
had set fire to the enemy's remaining ships :-a measure he had deferred
in the hope ol capturing them. Plutarch (Aut. LXVHI) quotes Octa
vian as stating in his account of the battle that three hundred ships were
taken, with not more than five thousand men slain in the encounter.

3. Ab Actio, etc. : this rather cumbersome sentence, said to be the
longest in the Lines, well illustratas the author's characteristic conciseness
of expression at the expense oi rhetorical form. Its length, however, is
quite exceptional, since his sentences in general are comparatively brief.
His subordmation by means ol participles, instead ol clauses or other
forms of expression, is particularly noteworthy: no less than ten are
thus employed. Oi these three (turbatus, conflictatus, commoratus) are
modifiers of the subject3 one (poscentium) usmps the place oi a relative
clause; while the remaining six are found in the ablativo absolute ex-
pressing time and attendant circumstances. In translating into English
make at least three coordinata sentences out oi the Latin sentence, end-
ing, respectively, with the words praemiserat, diffracto and potitus est.

in the Sporades group off the coast of Ionia3 modern Samo, the Turkish

the expiration ol sixteen years oi service and of 3000 denarii for the legion·
aries after twenty years of service. Some ol the demands at this time
