22. ad remum datis: see Introd. 11. §5- b. (8). portum Iulium:
though possessed 01 harbors at Ravenna and Brundisium on the Adriatic,
Rome laoked natural harbor iacilities on the Tirscan ses. Agrippa 'saw
that it was possible to construet a harbor out 01 the two small lakes lyIng
between Puteoli and Misenum. His work apparently consisted in
strengthening with masonry the sand bar between the Lucrine lake and
the outer bay, drengnga charmel through this lake and cutting a canal
between it and Lake Avernus. The name portas Iullus was in honor
01 his patron's house. The harbersoon fell into disuse, especially aiter
Octavian had established a naval station at the mouth 01 the Tiber. Το-
day few traces 01 the entrance to the harbor are discernible beneath the
waters oi the hay oi Pozzuoli3 while Lake Avernus is simply a reedy
marsh. See Frandsen, Life os Agrippa, 140 11. and compare Dio XLVIII.

25. Mylas et Naulochum: Naulochus was, apparently, a roadsteed
between Mylae, modern Milone, on the northeastern coast 01 Sicily and
the promontory 01 Pelorus. Reierence is here made to the second battle
between Agrippa and Sextus, to the east 01 Mylae. In a prevlous en-
gagement, west 01 Mylae, Agrippa had been only partially victorious.
In the interval between these battles Octavian had landed 0001101110-
menium, modern Taormina, and in his defeat had incurred grave per-
sonal danger. Soon afterward he succeeded in landing an enormous
army at Mylae. The naval victory 01 Naulochos and surrender 01 Pom-
pey's land forces ensued. Pompey lost all hut seventeen ships and left
at once 101 the East. These decisive battles were fought in the autumn
01 36 ac. Itis uncertain whether September third was the date 01 the
naval victory or 01 the surrender 01 the army 01 Lepidus. See App,
