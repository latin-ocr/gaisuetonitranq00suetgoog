Horace (Sat. 1. 3. st) speaks of tristes Kalendae, but with reference to ¹

the payment of interest on the first day of the mouth.

12. hoo Catone: our present (luto. Valerius Maximus (H. 10. 8)
says of 011οἐ perfeeto uirtus: Quae quidem effecit at qutsquls sanctum et
corculum ciuem sipaillcure uelit, sub nomine Catonis definiat. But the
unattainable is not 10 be expected even from a Cato l

15. bacculum: probably from βάκηλος, which is defined by Hesy-
chius as ἀνόητοι ; and so, ‘stupld dolt' instructos ‘seul’ may be the
meaning here. See Introd. 11. 5 1. b. apud pullum pulleiaceum:
pro pullo of certain MSS. is 10 be preferred to opud pullum : sor ⁵ durh ',
‘dorklsb'. Pullet'oceumisquoted only ior this passage. See Introd. 11.
ς 1. t. pro cerrito vacerrosum ι sor 601101111111111, ι1101111111 ’;
since esserra, ‘log', ί110011’, is used, like stipes, for ‘stock', ⁶ blook' as 1
term of abiise. See Introd. Π. ξ 1. b.

16. vapldeeehaberepro male: ‘feel stule’for‘feel 10ᾱὶ Vopldus
isrued of stale, flat wine ; ef. suppo. See Introd. II. ξ 1. b. ,

1⁷. betizare pro languere, etc. : ‘bc deod beet (beot) 'for‘ be deod
tired' which in sulpur ptruse ls ‘ be (tite) deod vepetuttes'. Some such
word-play is probably intended. Bettzore is evidently connected with
beta, ‘beet' ; ef. Cet. LXVII. 21, Lonyur'dlor tenero. . . beto. See
Introd. 11. ἓ 1. b. The colloquialism, or slang expression, tantustantus
aLatin verb, it seems, formed on the root of the Greek λάχανα, ‘vege-
tuble greens’, luparitanus, ‘guther vegetables'3 *see Introd. 11. § 1. d.

18. aimus pro sumus: simus and summ, subjunctive and indica-

tive, may'have represented the same change as is noticeable in monimus,
monemus. Or it may have been an instance of analogy at work. See
Lindsay, Lot. caup. 29. casu: casus was used by the Latin grem-
mariaus 10 translate the technical term πτῶσις of the Greek. Gerwttcus
(cesus) does not, however, properly translate ἡ γενικὴ πτῶσις of the
Greek. '
’ 19. domnos: the older form oi the genitive, with the sufflx -os,·
while domus is the later form, with the suffix -s. There was no form
domos ior this case. Possibly, Augustus used it for domus on the analogy
of domus, demusin the accusative plural. See Lindsay, Lat. Lonp.
