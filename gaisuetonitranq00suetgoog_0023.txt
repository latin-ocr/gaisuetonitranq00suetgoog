great public librarios, especially those founded by Augustus at
the temple of Apollo on the Palatina, were probably the chief

scene of his labors afterwards. No doubt he had

to him what the Sabine farm was to Horace. We have no
indicationes the date of his death. The number and variety
of his works indicate a long life, for we know that he kept
