2. 11111111 Dialis: the chief of the greater flamens: the others were
the Martialis and Quirinalis; there were 1 dozen or more minor flamens.
The rules for conduct, dress, and mode of life were excessively burden-
some and strict in the ease of the flamen Dialis. They 111 given in
detail by Aulus Gellius (X. 11), and the formalities of election are de-
scribed by Tacitus (Ann. IV. 16) end Dio (LIV. 36. 1). In regard to
Caesar's nomination Velleius Paterculus (II. 43) says: oum poene puer
a Morio Cinnaque flamen Dialis creatus, uictoria Sullae, qai omnia oh
iis noto fecerat irrito, amisisset id sacerdotium, etc. Marius died in 86
s.c.; Cinna, 84110. lt was to succeed L. Cornelius Merula that Caesar
was nominated. Marius had married Caesar's aunt. Merula ha'd oom-

office was not filled until seventy-five years later (Tacitus says seventy·
two), when Augustus inaugurated a flamen Dialis in 11111. (Tae, Ana.
111. ts). See Warde Fowler‚ Aa Unnoticed Troit in tlte Character os
Julius Caesar, Classical Reviso, XXX (1916), page 69. The trait is
Caesar's life-long interest in caerimonia, antiquarianism‚ and ritual.

Pompey in 59 ac. She died in 54 110.

6. repudiaret: the formal renunciation of the marriage relation, ad-
dressed by one of the parties to the other, was called repudiant. dicta-
tore Bulla: note thet the title precedes the name in this case, reversing
the usual order ; Introd. II. ς 10. h. (1).

’1. Quare . . . multatus: this does not all refer 1ο one date, bnt all
