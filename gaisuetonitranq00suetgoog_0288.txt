Pannoniam, Dalmatians and Salassi, no less‘than his prudent and con·
servativa 001100 01 aetion towards the seliexpatriated Antony and his
escapades in the orient, commanded the increasing respect and admira-
tion 01 the Roman mind. Antony's proposed assignment 01 eastern
kingdoms 10 his children by Cleopatra and, particularly, his recognition 01
Caesarion as the legitimare heir 01 010011 and Cleopatra were sufficient
