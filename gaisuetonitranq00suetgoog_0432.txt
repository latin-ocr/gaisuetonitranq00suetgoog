whom he wished and in the manner that suited him best. Its nature
might thus become known and its contenis repeated by others. Tacitus,
as well as Dio, may have read or heard 01 such a iourth document. Cf.
Tac, Ann. Ι. 11. 5 ff. : proferri libellum recitarique iussit. Opes publicae
continebantur, quantum ciuium sociorumque in annis, quot classes, regua,
provinciae, tributa aut aectipaiia, et massitaus ac tarpitiones. Quae
curata sua manu perscripserat Aupuetus addideratque cumdium coerceruii
intra tenninosirnperii, incertum metu an per inuidiam. The last state
ment oi the Tacitus passage ean hardly reier to the breuiarium and must
have reference to the fourth document mentioned by Dio. 0111011 to
page 17, line 15.

2. indicem rerum a se gestarum: an account of bis acbuvements. s
Mace (Essai sur Sabiona, 137) points 0111 that our authnr's nse 01 uellet
(line 3), rather than 101111, indicates that the emperor’s wish oi having
this record inscribed on bronze tablets was not realized. The greater
part 01 an exact copy inscribedon marble in Greek and Latin characters
has been preserved at Ancyra (modern Angora), 111 Galatia, in Asia Minor.
This is the Monumentum Anepranum so often quoted in these notes.
There are also fragments 01 1 copy 11 Apollonia in Pisidia. The title 11
this inscription, thrice repeated, seems to prove conclusively that the origi-
nal copy was engraved on pilae, columns or pillars, which stood in front 01
the Mausoleum at Rome: Rerum gestarum diui Augusti . . . incisarum
tn duabus abeneis pilis, quae sunt Romae positae, exemplar subiectam. Ι
Ι)11 (-Xiph. LVI. 33. 1) states that Augustus ‘gave orders 11111 they should
be inscribed 011 bronze stelae placed near the Mausoleum ³. The reproduc-
tions in the provinces were, apparently, urscribed on temples of Augustus
and Rome ; see note 1ο page 77, 11111 13. The Greek version was in the
κοινὴ διάλεκτος, the Greek language as commonly spoken in polite circles
11 that time. The best text is that restored and revised by Theodor
Mommsennes Gestae Diui Aupusti, 1883. See Introd. Ι, peges XIV 11.

4. breviarium totius imperti: a tabulated schedula os tbe state cs
ibe entire empire. In Galb. 12. 3, breuiarium rationum means ‘an ab·
stractus accounts ’. The rationes imperii ab Auyustc proponi solitas 01
Gaiip. 16. 1 refers to the ‘balance sheet' that was periodically published.
See note 10 page 62, line ’1. Cf. Tac, Anu. Ι. 11. b 11., quoted above in
note 1011111 1. See Introd. 1Ιῖ § 1. b.

6. serario et flecis: tbe public and imperial treasuries. See note to
page 69, line 31. uectigaliorum residuis: arrears of tanes. The
torm aectipaliorum occurs again in Gatip. 16. 3, while the more common
form ls found in Tib. 49. 2.
