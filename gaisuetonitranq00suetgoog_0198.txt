plebl scito: Pompey when sole consul in 52 rac. had allowed some oi
the tribunes to carry a law permitting Caesar to be a candidate while
still absent irom Rome. Apparently abrogare was used transitivcly in
theclassical period. abrogasset: hod 00001100 ,· most editions read
abrogasset. The law as passed did not contain the clause excepting
Caesar from the general requirement that all candidates must be present
at the time of the canvass. But it had been intended to except Caesar;
therefore Pompey‚ aiter the law had been passed, inscribed on a bronze
tablet, and deposited in the aerariam, went and made the alteration,
inserting the clause in Caesar's favor. Marcellus held that he had
no right to do so, and that the law, without the exception, was still in
force. His opinion was apparently correct.
