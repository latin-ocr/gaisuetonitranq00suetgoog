often employed ot electione. To secure votes secretly, interpretes
were used to make the bargain and sequestres, election agents, held the
sumsof money to be disbursed by diobores. There were many enaot
menta against bribery (arathus), but not uncommonly money was dis
tributed among the members of one's own tribe. A oanvass (ambitio),
however, did not necessarily assume the form of bribery. Suetonius
says (Any. 40. 2) that Augiistus himself used this means to prevent
members of his tribes from being bribed by any candidate’s supporters
(aegrescere). The action of Julius Caesar may also bc compared ; see
Jal. 19. 1. Political clubs (collepmsodcztcte) hired operae campestres,
the modern ‘ward heelers'‚ to intimidate or encourage voters to vote tor y
their candidates for office. Elections were held in the Campus Martius ;
hence the use oi campestris in this connection.

Drumann (Gescle. Rome, IV2. 246) suggests that he may have been
commissioned with judicial authority in 63 a.c., the year of his son's
birth 3 cf. Ace. 94. 5. But Suetonius makes specific mention of no office
before his praetorship, which was in 61 ao. He is content to state that
all his offioes were ‘filled with distinction '. adeptus. . . admini-
