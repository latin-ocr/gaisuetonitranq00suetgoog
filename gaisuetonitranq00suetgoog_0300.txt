1³. (Marci Aemili) Lepidi: son of the triumvir and of lunia

(sister of M. Brutus) ; Velleius (II. 88. l) speaks oi him as iuvenis somna
paam memte melior. Livy (libii. CXXXIII) apparently dates the con-
spiracy after the triumph of 29 ac. Velleius states that Lepidus had
formulated his plans, dam ultimam belia rictiaco Alexandriaeque Caesar
imperiii mamam, to assissinato Octavian immediately upon his return
from Egypt. The conspiracy was suppressed by Maecenas and punish-
ment meted out tc Lepidus. His father's treatment by Octavian since
36 no. and his mother's natural antipathy to the emperor were largely
responsible ior the plot. See Dio LIV. 15. 4f. ; App, B. Ο. IV. 50. 216ff.;

Varronis. . . Caepionis: A. Licinius Murena was adopted by A.
Terentius Varro and was then known as A. Terentius Varro Murena.
He was thus the brother of Terentia, Maecenas's wife, and brother cr
cousin of the Proculeius of Horace, Od. 11. 2. eff. Sent against the
Alpina tribe of the Salassi in 25 u.c., Murena reduced them tc submission
and founded the city of Augusta Praetoria, modern Aosta3 cf. Dio LIII.

conspiracy in 23-22 s.c.‚ not even his distInguished connectione could
save him from condemnation. Dio intimatas (LIV. 3. 4-5) that the accu-
. sation may have been a calumny and credits Murena with an unsparing
outspokenness to all alike. Horace's prophetie words in the ode (H. 10)
addressed to him may well be recalled to mind. Connected with this
conspiracy was the estrangement between Augustus and Maecenas; see
note to page 85, line l. Nothing further is known of Caepio than what
Velleius (II. 91. 2) tells us by way of contrasting him with Murena:
quippe L. Marma et Fannius Caepio diversis moribus (nam Murena siae
boc facinore potuit arderi bonus, Caepio et cate icc erat pessimas) cam
iniissent occidendi Ouescms consilia, oppressi auctoritate publica, qaod ci
secere coluerant, iare passi suat. The! prosecution was conducted by
Tiberius3 cf. Tib. 8. Both men failed to appear ior trial, were con·
demned in their absence from the city and were executed soon after-
wards; cf. Dic LIV. 3. 5-6. Μ. Egnati (Rlifi)= as aedIlein2013c.‚
he won popular favor by the aid rendered during a fire and was made
praetor the following year, contrary to law. C. Sentius Saturninus,
