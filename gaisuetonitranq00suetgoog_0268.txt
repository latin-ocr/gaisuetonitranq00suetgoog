occurred in May and lasted eleven days. At this time the comet typify-
ing ansar's apotheosis appeared on seven successive nights; oi. Jal. 88 ;
Dio XLV. 7. 1.

25. audentibus: sc. eis; see Introd. 11. ᾗ 9. a. (ὃ). qulbus. . .
munus: to whose lot this office lad sallem probably, the college oi
priests, whose duties involved the exhibition of shows froin year to year.

2⁷. locum . . . demortui: the vacancy due to the death of Helvius
Cinna when he was mistaken by the mob ior the assassin, L. Cornelius
Cinna, and literally torn to pieces. The story is told in J ul. 85. can·
didatum ee ostendit: aaaoaaced himself as caadiaate. Octavian had
put iorwanl a certain Flaminius lor the office, but the people, in disregard
of qualifications oi age and rank, would have none other than the young
Octavian. Through his consular power oi coercitio Antony stopped the
proceedings and the vacancy remained unfilled.

28. quanquam patricius: see note to page 49, line 23, and Introd.
II. §a m. necdum senator: to disregard the careas honoram, while
not illegal, was at least irregular. Octavian had not held the quaestor-
ship, which had quahfied ior the senate since Sulla’s time, and only sen·
ators were eligible ior the office oi tribune. His 'age might have been a
third objection. adversante. . . Antonio: Octavian was opposed
by Antony in his claim for his patrimony, with regard to the lea cunata
necessary for his adoption, respecting the exercises in honoros Julius and
in his candidacy ior the office oi tabanus suffectus, as seen above.

29. quem . . . speraverat: safataram esse5 ia whom he laad toperi
most especially to fiad aa ally; see Introd. II. ξ 10. d. (1). Vel with
praecipuas here and elsewhere in Suetonius has about the same force as
when used with a superlative ; see page 10, line 21, uel praecipua opera ;
page 62, line 24, e quibas ael praecipua ,¹ page 65, line 20, ael praecipuam
calumniandi materiam,· Dum. 19, rel praecipuo stadio; and, with the
adverb, Ner. 22. l, ael praecipue ,· Vit. 13. 1, Sed uel praecipue.

30. ne publicum. . . hanelatmm lue: notavere ille eommoajuatice
ulrich belonped to all alilce. Whether the more usual tralaticium or the
translativam of the Mes. be read here, the meaning is unmistalrable.
Fora time, at least, Antony thwarted Octavian’s adoption into apatri-
aian house and his aspiratione to the tribunate. See Introd. II, ᾖ 1. c on
the technical phrase here used.
