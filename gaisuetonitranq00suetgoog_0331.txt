holding the inslgnia of the consul's office, gave back to the senate some
01 its former rights 01 provincial control and restored the duties, at least,
of the ancient censor aiter a lapse 01 iorty-two years; sce Tac, Aua. ΠΙ.

he did not think 01 laying down, it seems, were the unusual powers in-
volved ln the tribunicia potestus and the imperium proconsulare and the
personal sacrosanctity and precedente vouchsaied him everywhere by
the- titles 01 Augustus and princepe· ci. Dio LII. 1. 1, LIII. 12. 1 ff.;
Strab. XVII. 3. 25. The second occasion 10 which our author alludes
was what appeared 1ο be a fatal illness in 23 rac. ; see note to page 49,
1111125. He seemingly acknowledged the right of senate and people to
appoint his successor; cf. Dio LIII. 30. 1-3. See Momms, Rcm.
