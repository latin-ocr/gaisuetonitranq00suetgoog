25. Quo tempore: 41 ao, i11 the consulship 01 Lucius Antonius and
P. Servilius Isauricus (II). L. Antonium: brother 01 the triumvir.
His life'was spared after Perusia and 110 was later appointed to a command
in Iberia. Another brother, Gaius, praetor in Macedonia in 44 no, had
met his death at the hands of M. Brutus in 42 rao. ¹

26. fraternae: = frotrts; 000 Introd. ΙΙ. §3. c. potentiae: political
power, especially with the veterans, who were the real masters 01 the
situation and through whose offices a settlement was ineffectually under-
taken. of. Dio XLVIII. 10. aff. Cicero (Phil. II. 11. 26) thus contrasts
potentio with dominatae: Quid? 0. Cassiae, ia eo somtlto satrapeae
uon modo dominatam, scd ae potentiam quidem cuiusquam ferre poton,
me auctorem, credo, desideravit. ree novae: an abortire rebellion
which originated in a woman's J'ealous passione and a man's selfish ambi-
tions. Fulvia, wife 01 Mark Antony‚ nihil muliebre praeter corpas ocreae
(Vell. ΙΙ. 74. 3), was intent upon winnIng back her husband’s roving ai-
1001101ιο from the wiles 01 Cleopatra, whatever the cost. Lucius Antonius,
’ while posing as the protector 01 his brother's rights and assuming the sur-
name 01 Pictos in taken 01 his devotion, was in reality infiuenoed by sel-
fish aime to taire advantage 01 the increasing discontent caused by the

confiscatione and allotrnents 01 land. Before the end 01 his year of office -

hc had joined Fulvia at Praeneste in open revolt. Cf, Dio XLVIII. ὁ. 4,
10. 111. confugere Perusiam coegit: at the beginning 01 the war
Antony had gained some slight successes during Octavian's absence from
Rome. But Octavian and Agrippa shrewdly outgeneraled the Antonian
forces and prevented their union. Checked in his progress towards the
north, Antonius withdrew to the strongly fortified Perusia, modern Pe-
rugia‚ situated on a group 01 hills rising upwards 01 0 thousand feet above
the valley 01 the Tiber in the modern province of Umbria. cf. Dio
xnvnr. 13. rff, 14. 1.

27. ad deditionem, eto: the siege lasted 110111 the close 01 41 a. 0.
to March, 40 n. c. Despite Dio’sstatement that the town had ample
provisions at the start, the tamine became so lutensely severe as to
make it memorable in Roman blstory. Authorities agree 111 attribut-
ing the capitulation to the stringency 01 the 101111110; 000 App, Β. 0.
