Viris Illustribus. This, however, is not mentioned in the
later 1111111 01 Plin'y, which extend to 109 11), 101 does
Pliny allude 10 any published work of Suetonius in his 94111
111111 10 Trajan urging his claims to the ias trium liberorum.
We may therefore conclude that this work did not appear
before the date of the letter (111-113 1111). 01 the other
hand, it is perhaps 1 1111 inference from St. Jerome's confusion
of the two Plinys in his De Viris Illustribas, which was based
in large measure upon Suetonius's work of the same name,
that the younger Pliny was not included in the 111111. The
probable reason for this 1111, 11 11 was a fact, is that Pliny
was still alive when it was published. Now Pliny died, as
we suppose, 11111311).

Tacitus and Suetonius so 11111 their extant works are con-
cerned, never mentioned each other. They were doubtless

acquainted, both being friends 01 Pliny, but
⁸⁹¹³ti⁰¹²t⁰ Tacitus was 10 superior in age, in position and in
mm genius that 1111 modest grammaticae would never
think 01 him as 11 equal. Suetonius chose for himself a by-
path in history, and never classed himself among historiens of
rank. His powers and his tastes fitted him for 1 lower 1111-
1101 in literature. His work was avaluable supplement, but
> in no sense a rival to that of the great historian of the em-
perors. Though their books covered the same period, they
were quite independent of each other.

Suetonius must have been acquainted with men, among the
group of Pliny’s friends, who could supply him with rich
material from their persona] recollectione, and he
must have had access for years to many private
records of the senatorial party, 11 he had later,
when Hadrian's secretary, to the imperial archives. His asso
ciations with the senatorial party manifestly affected his
sympathies, which throughout the XII 0111111 led him to
favor those emperors who, like Augustus, treated the Senate
with deference and respect, and to' take the most unfavorable
