Yet the epithet was so often applied 10 Octavian in a contemptuous sense,
Servius (ud 1701111011. 42) states, that the senate decreed that no one
should speak 01 him as puer in the future. What Octavian particularly
had in mind was douhtless the familiar saying 01 Cicero (od Fam. XI.
20. 1), laudandum adolescentem, ornandum, tollendum, where, as Vel·
leius (ΙΙ. 62. 6) points out, the word tollendum was intentionally used in
a double sense, since 1011110 may mean ‘make way with, destroy' as well
as ‘exalt honor ³. Some hold, however, that tollere could not have the
meaning, ‘raiae to honor ³, without some additional word, asin Hor, Od.
