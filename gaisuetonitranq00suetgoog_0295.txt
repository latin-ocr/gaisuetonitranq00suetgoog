21. tumulum: the unflnished mausoleum 01 Cleopatra in the royal
palace 3 01. Dio LI. 8. 6, 10. 611.

22. Antoninm iuvenem : Marcus, elder son 01 Antony by Fulvia, the
Antyllus 01 Ι)10 and Plutarch, to whom Octavian's daughter had been
betrothed in 37 rac. as a politIcal expedient and without serious thought
01 the match being consummated. After Actium he was sent on 0110 01
Antony's fruitless embassies to Octavian. He was betrayed, as was
Caesarion, according to Plutarch, by his pedagogue Theodorus. A
younger son 01 Antony by Fulvia, Iulus Antonius, was spared and was
reared by the noble Octavia. See Dio XLVIII. 54. 4, LI. 6. 1, 8. 4, 15. 5 ;
Ρ1111., Ant. LXXXI, LXXXVII.

23. simulacro: probably an image of Julius in the mausoleum built
in his honor by Cleopatra. The apa1tment 111 which the queen received
OctavIan is said to have contained many images oi Julius Caesar. The
.sanctity attaching to such shrines as an asylum 101 fugitives in later times
would hardly serve at any time 101 one subject to a charge 01 maiestas.
Yet the triumvirs had, themselves, enacted that such privilege 01 asylum
should attach to the shrine of the deified Julius. See Dio XLVII. 19. 21.,
LI. 12. l ff, 15. 5. simulacro: here follows abreptum more usual
would be the ablativa and the preposition u: see Introd. II. §a k.

25. Caesarionem: so called by permission oi Julius ; see page 26,
11110 26. Plutarch (Ocea. XLIX) speaks 01 the name as commonly
applied 10 him by the Alexandriana Dio refers to him (XLVII.
31.5) as a pretended son 01 Caesar. Antony's reason ior representing
him to he atrue son 01 Caesar was evidently tc bring discredit upon
Octavian as an adopted son; see Dio XLIX. 41.2 1.; Jnl. 52. 2, with
note to page 26, 11110 29.

26. retractume fuga: realizinghis danger, his mother had started
him on his way to India hy way 01 Aethiopia, but he was Induced hy hle
pedagogue to return on the ground that Octavian would place him on the
throne 01 Egypt; cf. Plut, Ant. LXXXI. Dio (LI. 15. 5) simply states
that hc was overtaken en route and murdered. suppucio adfecit: pat
him to dcutb; 01. Caes, Β. O. 1. 21. 4, timore perterriti ne .. . supplicIo
macerentur. Plutarch (Ant. LXXXI) asserts that in deciding his iate
Octavian was influenced by Areius's shrewd adaptation 01 Homer's
famous saying (Il. II. 204), ‘'Tis no good thing, a multitude 01 Caesars’,
through the substitution 01 πολυκαισαρίη 101 Homer's mlvrorparin, ‘the rule
01 many‘; ci. Dora. 12. 3. 'Phe vvords following this Homeric quotation,
ι1101 there be one ruler, one king ', were used on one occasion by Ca-
ligula ; 01. 00122. 1.
